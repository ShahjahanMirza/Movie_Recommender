. This is a simple movie recommender, built by using cosine similarity on Python.🐍

. The data was scraped from IMDB and compiled into a csv, names FinalMovies.csv. :neckbeard:

. The script is pretty straighforwards using NLTK, sklearn and Pandas. 

. The requirements.txt file has the libraries used and the main.py file is the one used to build and run the app. 

. The recommender can be greatly improved such as, you can use writers as well. 

. Open to any issues or improvement advices 💗
